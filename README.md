# Vision-based Distributed Flock Control of Multiple Robots using Distributed Estimation and Vision-based Navigation
Senior Project for Bradley University. Vision-based multiple robot formation tracking.


  This project contains Simulink code and matlab code for both implementation and simulation of multi-agent target tracking robots, respectively. Work is currently in progress. 
  Code is designed to be implemented on QBot2 which features a kinect camera based on depth/RGB. The design will feature a vision-based approach to localization and encircling a moving target.
