\section{Division of Labor}
Ryan Clue implemented our image processing methods, created the initial Stateflow model, and provided the Simulink design for integrating the image processing modules with the kinematic modules.

Anthony Le implemented our kinematic control systems, created our Matlab data logging module, and extended our Stateflow model for the Leader-Follower program.

Anthony and Ryan worked jointly to debug and troubleshoot.
